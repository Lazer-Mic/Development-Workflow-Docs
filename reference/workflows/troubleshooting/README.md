# Troubleshooting Workflow

## Overview
Our troubleshooting workflow provides systematic approaches to identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues across our development ecosystem, from technical problems to workflow bottlenecks.

## Troubleshooting Philosophy
- **Systematic Approach**: Methodical problem identification and resolution
- **Documentation First**: Record problems and solutions for future reference
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Address underlying causes, not just symptoms
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Build collective troubleshooting knowledge
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from each issue to prevent recurrence

## Problem Classification System
### Issue Categories
```yaml
Technical Issues:
  - Code/Logic Errors: Bugs in code or content
  - Build/Deployment Failures: Pipeline and deployment issues
  - Performance Problems: Slow builds, loading, or execution
  - Configuration Issues: Tool or system misconfigurations
  - Dependency Problems: Package or tool dependency conflicts

Workflow Issues:
  - Process Bottlenecks: Inefficient workflows or procedures
  - Communication Gaps: Misaligned expectations or requirements
  - Tool Limitations: Inadequate tools for specific tasks
  - Resource Constraints: Time, skill, or system limitations
  - Integration Problems: Tool or system integration failures

Environmental Issues:
  - System Configuration: OS or hardware-related problems
  - Network Connectivity: Internet or service connectivity issues
  - Authentication: Access and permission problems
  - Storage Issues: Disk space or file system problems
  - Security Concerns: Security-related restrictions or vulnerabilities
```

### Severity Classification
```markdown
# Issue Severity Levels

## Critical (P0) - Immediate Action Required
- Production systems down
- Security vulnerabilities exposed
- Data loss or corruption
- Complete workflow blockage
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 1 hour)

## High (P1) - Urgent Resolution Needed
- Major functionality broken
- Deployment pipeline failed
- Significant performance degradation
- Multiple users affected
- **Response Time**: Same day (< 8 hours)

## Medium (P2) - Important but Not Urgent
- Minor functionality issues
- Workflow inefficiencies
- Single user affected
- Workarounds available
- **Response Time**: Within 3 days

## Low (P3) - Enhancement or Minor Issue
- Cosmetic issues
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Documentation gaps
- Process optimizations
- **Response Time**: Next sprint/iteration
```

## Troubleshooting Methodology
### Systematic Problem-Solving Process
```yaml
# 7-Step Troubleshooting Process
1. Problem Identification
   - Gather detailed problem description
   - Reproduce the issue consistently
   - Document error messages and symptoms
   - Identify affected systems and users

2. Information Gathering
   - Collect relevant logs and error messages
   - Document system configuration
   - Identify recent changes or updates
   - Check related systems and dependencies

3. Hypothesis Formation
   - Brainstorm potential root causes
   - Prioritize hypotheses by likelihood
   - Consider multiple possible causes
   - Document assumptions and reasoning

4. Testing & Validation
   - Test each hypothesis systematically
   - Implement minimal test cases
   - Document test results
   - Eliminate confirmed non-causes

5. Solution Implementation
   - Implement the verified solution
   - Test solution thoroughly
   - Document implementation steps
   - Verify problem resolution

6. Verification & Monitoring
   - Confirm issue is fully resolved
   - Monitor for recurrence
   - Validate no new issues introduced
   - Update affected documentation

7. Documentation & Learning
   - Document problem and solution
   - Update troubleshooting guides
   - Share knowledge with team
   - Implement prevention measures
```

## Common Issue Categories & Solutions
### Development Environment Issues
```bash
# mdBook Build Failures
# Problem: mdBook build fails with unclear errors
# Solution: Check common causes

# 1. Check mdBook version
mdbook --version
# Update if needed: cargo install --force mdbook

# 2. Validate book.toml syntax
mdbook build --dry-run

# 3. Check for broken links
mdbook test

# 4. Verify file permissions
find src -name "*.md" -exec ls -la {} \;

# 5. Clean and rebuild
mdbook clean
mdbook build

# 6. Check for special characters in filenames
find src -name "*[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]*"
```

### Git & GitHub Issues
```bash
# Git Authentication Problems
# Problem: Git operations fail with authentication errors
# Solution: Fix SSH/authentication setup

# 1. Test SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# 2. Check SSH key
ls -la ~/.ssh/

# 3. Add SSH key if missing
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# 4. Update remote URL to use SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/repo.git

# 5. Verify configuration
git config --list | grep user
```

### GitHub Actions Failures
```yaml
# Deployment Pipeline Debugging
# Problem: GitHub Actions workflow fails

# Common Solutions:
1. Check Workflow Syntax:
   - Validate YAML syntax
   - Check action versions
   - Verify required permissions

2. Debug Steps:
   - Add debug output to workflow
   - Check action logs in detail
   - Verify environment variables

3. Resource Issues:
   - Check runner resource limits
   - Verify storage availability
   - Monitor build timeouts

# Debug Action Example:
- name: Debug Information
  run: |
    echo "Runner OS: ${{ runner.os }}"
    echo "GitHub Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
    echo "Branch: ${{ github.ref }}"
    echo "Working Directory:"
    pwd
    ls -la
    echo "Environment Variables:"
    env | sort
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Slow Build Times
# Problem: mdBook builds are taking too long
# Solution: Optimize build process

# 1. Profile build time
time mdbook build

# 2. Check file sizes
du -sh src/
find src -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg" | xargs du -sh | sort -hr

# 3. Optimize images
# Install image optimization tools
brew install pngquant jpegoptim

# Compress images
find src -name "*.png" -exec pngquant --ext .png --force {} \;
find src -name "*.jpg" -exec jpegoptim --max=85 {} \;

# 4. Enable build caching
# Add caching to GitHub Actions workflow

# 5. Reduce unnecessary rebuilds
# Check for unnecessary file changes triggering rebuilds
```

### macOS System Issues
```bash
# Development Tool Problems
# Problem: Homebrew or development tools not working

# 1. Update Homebrew
brew update
brew doctor

# 2. Fix common Homebrew issues
brew cleanup
brew autoremove

# 3. Reset command line tools
sudo xcode-select --reset
xcode-select --install

# 4. Check PATH configuration
echo $PATH
# Verify tools are in PATH

# 5. Reset shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc
# Or restart terminal
```
