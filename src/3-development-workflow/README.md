# Development Workflow

This section covers the complete development workflow for creating and maintaining documentation.

## Overview

The development workflow consists of several key phases:
1. **Content Creation** - Writing and organizing documentation
2. **Local Testing** - Previewing changes before deployment
3. **Version Control** - Managing changes with Git
4. **Deployment** - Publishing to GitHub Pages

## Quick Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes to documentation
# 2. Test locally
mdbook serve --open

# 3. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new documentation section"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 5. GitHub Actions automatically deploys
```

## Content Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Include screenshots for complex procedures
- Follow the established file organization
- Test all links and images locally

# Markdown Guidelines

This guide covers the markdown formatting standards for the documentation project.

## Basic Formatting

### Headers
```markdown
# Main Title
## Section Title
### Subsection Title
```

### Links
```markdown
[Link Text](url)
[Internal Link](relative/path.md)
```

### Images
```markdown
![Alt Text](image.png)
![Alt Text](image.png "Optional Title")
```

### Code Blocks
````markdown
```bash
# Command example
git add .
```
````

## Content Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Include code examples where helpful
- Use consistent formatting
- Test all links before committing

# Image Management

This guide covers best practices for managing images in the documentation.

## Image Guidelines

- Use PNG format for screenshots
- Optimize images for web (compress when possible)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Store images alongside content files

## File Organization

```text
src/
├── section-name/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── screenshot-1.png
│   └── screenshot-2.png
```

## Image Optimization

- Compress PNG files
- Use appropriate dimensions
- Include alt text for accessibility

# Local Testing

This guide covers testing documentation changes locally before deployment.

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Build the documentation
mdbook build

# Serve locally with auto-reload
mdbook serve --open

# Check for broken links
mdbook test
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Navigation works properly
- [ ] Images display correctly
- [ ] Links are functional
- [ ] Code examples are formatted properly

## Common Issues

- Missing image files
- Broken internal links
- Incorrect file paths
- Syntax errors in markdown

# File Organization

This guide covers the file organization structure for the documentation project.

## Directory Structure

```text
src/
├── SUMMARY.md                    # Table of contents
├── 1-introduction/              # Project overview
├── 2-tools-setup/               # Development environment
├── 3-development-workflow/      # Content creation
├── 4-deployment/                # Deployment process
└── 5-best-practices/            # Quality guidelines
```

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for directory names
- Use descriptive names
- Number directories for ordering
- Keep names short but clear

## File Guidelines

- Use README.md for main content
- Store images alongside content
- Use consistent file extensions
- Avoid special characters in names
