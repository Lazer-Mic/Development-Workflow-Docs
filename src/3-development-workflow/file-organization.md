# File Organization

This guide covers the file organization structure for the documentation project.

## Directory Structure

```
src/
├── SUMMARY.md                    # Table of contents
├── 1-introduction/              # Project overview
├── 2-tools-setup/               # Development environment
├── 3-development-workflow/      # Content creation
├── 4-deployment/                # Deployment process
└── 5-best-practices/            # Quality guidelines
```

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names
- Number directories for ordering
- Keep names short but clear

## File Guidelines

- Use README.md for main content
- Store images alongside content
- Use consistent file extensions
- Avoid special characters in names
