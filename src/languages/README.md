# Programming Languages

This section covers programming languages, markup languages, and configuration formats used in our development workflow. Each language section provides comprehensive coverage of syntax, best practices, and practical examples for development work.

## Languages Covered

### Web Technologies
- **[HTML & CSS](html-css/README.md)** - Web markup and styling fundamentals
- **[JavaScript](javascript/README.md)** - Client-side and server-side JavaScript development

### Documentation & Configuration
- **[Markdown](markdown/README.md)** - Documentation and content creation
- **[YAML & TOML](yaml-toml/README.md)** - Configuration file formats

### Systems Programming
- **[Rust](rust/README.md)** - Systems programming and performance-critical applications
- **[Python](python/README.md)** - Scripting, automation, and application development

## Learning Approach

Each language section is structured to provide:

1. **Fundamentals** - Core syntax and concepts
2. **Best Practices** - Industry standards and conventions
3. **Practical Examples** - Real-world code snippets and patterns
4. **Tool Integration** - Editor setup, linting, and development workflow
5. **Project Applications** - How we use each language in our projects

## Development Environment

Our multi-language development setup includes:
- **Editor**: Cursor IDE with language-specific extensions
- **Terminal**: iTerm2 with shell integration
- **Version Control**: Git for all language projects
- **Package Management**: Language-specific package managers
- **Documentation**: mdBook for technical documentation

This comprehensive language reference serves as both learning material and quick reference for development work across all our projects.
