# Project Templates: Documentation Design Study

## Overview
This section analyzes how the Development-Workflow-Docs project itself serves as a template and reference pattern for creating mdBook-based documentation projects, rather than maintaining a formal template collection.

## Actual Template Approach
Instead of pre-built templates, this project demonstrates **documentation by example** - using the Development-Workflow-Docs repository as a living template that can be studied, adapted, and replicated for new documentation projects.

## What We Don't Have (Yet)
- **Formal Template Collection**: No `/templates` directory with boilerplate projects
- **Setup Scripts**: No automated project initialization scripts  
- **Multiple Project Types**: Currently focused on mdBook documentation only
- **Template Versioning**: No formal versioning system for template updates

## What We Do Have: Real Implementation Patterns
This project provides actual, working examples of:
- **mdBook Configuration**: Real `book.toml` with proven settings
- **GitHub Actions Deployment**: Functional `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Content Organization**: 28-file documentation structure that works
- **Navigation Design**: SUMMARY.md organization patterns

## Current Project as Template Reference

### What Actually Works in This Project
```toml
# book.toml - Real configuration that deploys successfully
[book]
authors = ["Michael Orlando"]
language = "en"
src = "src"
title = "Development Workflow Documentation"

[output.html]
site-url = "/Development-Workflow-Docs/"
git-repository-url = "https://github.com/Lazer-Mic/Development-Workflow-Docs"
edit-url-template = "https://github.com/Lazer-Mic/Development-Workflow-Docs/edit/main/src/{path}"

[output.html.search]
enable = true
prebuild-index = true
```

## Using This Project as a Template
### Manual Template Process (What Actually Works)
```bash
# Clone this project as starting point
git clone https://github.com/Lazer-Mic/Development-Workflow-Docs.git new-project

# Clean up for new project
cd new-project
rm -rf .git book/
git init

# Update book.toml for new project
# Change title, authors, site-url, git-repository-url

# Update content structure
# Modify src/SUMMARY.md for new navigation
# Replace content in src/ directories

# Set up new repository
gh repo create new-project
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initialize project from Development-Workflow-Docs template"
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new-project.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Key Configuration Updates Needed
```toml
# book.toml changes for new project
[book]
title = "Your New Project Title"           # Update this
authors = ["Your Name"]                    # Update this

[output.html]
site-url = "/Your-Repo-Name/"              # Update this
git-repository-url = "https://github.com/username/Your-Repo-Name"  # Update this
edit-url-template = "https://github.com/username/Your-Repo-Name/edit/main/src/{path}"  # Update this
```

## Future Automation Possibilities
### What We Could Build (But Haven't Yet)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Potential setup.sh script for the future

# This script doesn't exist yet, but could be created to:
# 1. Clone Development-Workflow-Docs
# 2. Remove .git and book/ directories
# 3. Update book.toml with new project details
# 4. Initialize new git repository
# 5. Set up GitHub repository

# Current reality: We do this manually following the process above
```

### Current Development Setup
```bash
# What we actually do for mdBook development
# Install Rust and mdBook if needed
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install mdbook

# Clone and set up project
git clone https://github.com/Lazer-Mic/Development-Workflow-Docs.git
cd Development-Workflow-Docs
mdbook serve --open
```

## Template Evolution & Maintenance
### How This Project Evolves as a Reference
Instead of formal template versioning, this project evolves organically:

```yaml
Current Maintenance Approach:
  frequency: Continuous improvement
  triggers:
    - Tool version updates (mdBook, GitHub Actions)
    - Documentation improvements
    - New workflow discoveries
    - Real usage feedback

Update Process:
  1. Direct Updates to Development-Workflow-Docs:
     - Update configurations when tools change
     - Improve documentation based on actual use
     - Add new sections as workflows develop
  
  2. No Formal Template Testing:
     - The project itself serves as the test
     - Live documentation validates functionality
     - GitHub Actions provide build validation
  
  3. Documentation of Changes:
     - Git commit history shows evolution
     - README badges show current status
     - Live site reflects latest working state
```

### Version Tracking via Git
```markdown
# How We Track Changes (Reality)

## Git History as Version Management
- Commits show incremental improvements
- Tags could mark major documentation milestones
- Branches for experimental documentation approaches

## No Formal Migration Process
- New projects copy the current state
- No breaking changes to worry about
- Continuous improvement rather than versioned releases
```

## Quality Assurance & Validation
### How We Ensure Quality (Current Reality)
```bash
# What we actually do to validate the project
cd Development-Workflow-Docs

# Test local build
mdbook build

# Test local serve
mdbook serve --open

# Verify deployment
# Push to main branch triggers GitHub Actions
# Check deployment status at github.com/repo/actions
```
